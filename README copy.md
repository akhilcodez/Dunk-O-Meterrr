### Project Description
A fun, browser-based biscuit monitoring app that alerts you with a buzzer sound right before your biscuit dissolves into tea saving you from messy crumbs and heartache.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Every tea lover knows the pain.  
- You dip... you chat... you forget...  
- ☠️ **Biscuit Collapse**  
- ☕ Crumb Soup  
- 💔 Emotional Damage 

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

We present the **Biscuit Dip Timer™**:  
- 📷 Scans biscuit packet barcode with your camera  
- 📚 Fetches *exact* dip time from our elite **Biscuit Crack Time Database**  
- ⏳ Starts a countdown with dramatic animations  
- 🚨 Plays a buzzer right before disaster
